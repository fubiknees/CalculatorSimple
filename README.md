## Goal:

Create an **HTML** Calculator that can perform basic operations (+,-,*,/) via **javascript**. The calculator should accept problems such as 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42. Notice PEMDAS is not being used rather each set of numbers is being evaluated as they are input without the 'equal' sign being pressed. f.e. 19 - 5 * 3 -> 14 * 3 = 42. Extra Credit on this assignment included adding decimal, +/-, and backspace functionality. **CSS** was used for group-like functions.

## Takeaways:

* I learned how to test my code and run the console.log for element values I did not predict. I cannot stress how valuable this information was in helping me realize why issues were occurring.

* The realized value in naming similar divs under the same name & just general organization of code. I made extensive notes to myself on what certain functions do and distinct lines of code that have high value overall. This practice allowed for greater understanding and the ability to improvise well. 

* I learned how an actual calculator works. The calculator is one of those common devices that is used by everyone and understood by very few. It was great breaking it down and understanding what it takes to make them work. The calculator built was rather basic, so I can appreciate the coding necessary for a higher-level calculator.
